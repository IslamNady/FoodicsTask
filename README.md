# FoodicsTask
I have Implemented the task using Cucumber BDD framework.
You can run the cases from TestRunner class
we have 1 feature file one for the The complete flow
you can find the feature files, step definitions and TestRunners in the test/java
you can find the pages, base class and properties under the main/java/stc package
we use the default reporting for cucumber (you can find reports under the target/reports folder)
